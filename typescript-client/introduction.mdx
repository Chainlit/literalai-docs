title: Installation
---

Check the Literal TypeScript Client on [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@literalai/client) for the documentation.

```shell
npm i @literalai/client@latest
```


## Instantiation

```ts
import { LiteralClient } from "@literalai/client";

const client = new LiteralClient(process.env["LITERAL_API_KEY"]);
```

#### Disable Thread and Step Ingestion APIs

When instantiating the client, you have the option to disable the Thread and Step ingestion APIs that comes with the SDK, like `thread.step()`. This can be useful when you want to disable this without changing the code. 

```ts
import { LiteralClient } from "@literalai/client";

const client = new LiteralClient(process.env["LITERAL_API_KEY"], disabled: true);
```
