# `0.0.511`

### New Features

This release introduces a new method to create attachments : `client.api.createAttachment`. This method is a wrapper around the `uploadFile` method and the `new Attachment` constructor. It allows you to create an attachment and attach it to a step in a single call.

The old method using `uploadFile` and `new Attachment` is considered obsolete, although it remains in the SDK for backward compatibility.

### Improvements

* `threadId` is now optional when creating an attachment or uploading a file
* `createAttachment` and `uploadFile` now accept file data in the following formats : ReadableStream, ReadStream, Buffer, File, Blob & ArrayBuffer

# `0.0.510`

## Breaking Changes

Revamp of the OpenAI instrumentation : instead of manually instrumenting each call result, you can now instrument OpenAI globally. Each subsequently call will be logged with no additional code.

This new implementation is context-aware and will log the OpenAI calls in the right steps and threads if you use the new wrapper syntax.

<Warning>
  If you were using the `instrumentation.openai` method in your code and upgrade the Literal AI SDK to `0.0.510`, you will get the following error at compile time : `error TS2554: Expected 0-1 arguments, but got 2.`.

  To fix this, you should move the `instrumentation.openai` call to the top of your code and remove the arguments apart from the optional `{ tags: []}` argument.

  You can find code examples in the [OpenAI Instrumentation](/integrations/openai) guide.

### New Features 

* `getOrCreatePrompt()`. For creating a new Prompt, use `getOrCreatePrompt()`. 

A Prompt is fully defined by its name, template_messages, settings and tools. If a prompt already exists for the given arguments, it is returned. Otherwise, a new prompt is created.

```jsdoc    
/* 
* @param name The name of the prompt to retrieve or create.
* @param templateMessages A list of template messages for the prompt.
* @param settings Optional settings for the prompt.
* @returns The prompt that was retrieved or created.
