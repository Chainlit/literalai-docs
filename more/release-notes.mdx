# 0.0.608-beta (June 4, 2024)

### New features

* **Compare** feature is now available! This compare feature allows you to compare between generations.
* We'll be debuting in the coming week with **self-service distribution** of the Literal AI platform for self-hosting
* A new **user role** has been added: "Annotator", a user that can add tags and scores to the observability entities (e.g. thread, step...) and has no access outside of those.
* Project administrator can now pick the role of a user when inviting.

### Improvements

* Literal AI API keys are now shared in the project. Before, admins could create "personal" API keys. The behavior of restricting access to admins is kept.
* We're continuing our push towards a more consistent - and prettier - User Experience:
  * We've switched to a more vibrant color scheme
  * Made some visual tweaks on the Dashboard page
  * Observability items such as Threads, Runs, and others will now display as full pages rather than side-panes
  * And lots of other improvements across the platform
* Some changes on the way the platform is deployed, both on our end and for our on-premise users :
  * Improved and centralized environment management
  * The Portkey AI Gateway is now handled directly inside the Node process
  * The `BUCKET_NAME` environment variable is no longer mandatory. Trying to store objects will log errors but not disrupt the rest of the operations

### Fixes

* This week's release sees a big focus on performance, especially on the `Users` and individual `Thread` pages
* We've also chased and squashed a few bugs related to :
  * Signing Attachment URLs (for object storage like S3)
  * Conflicts on unique `userId`
  * A visual bug on initialization of “continuous” score templates
* Audio attachments are now resolved.
* Links on prompt versions are now directed to the correct prompt.
* Show the correct projects when accessing the prompt playground.

# 0.0.607-beta (May 27, 2024)

### New features

* Added online evaluations to score LLM generations on the fly.
* Created the endpoint /api/my-project to quickly access a project ID with an API key
* Brushed up the Dashboard page with:
  * Browser-level customizable layouts of charts
  * Filters on each chart to select relevant data - also saved at the browser level
* Specific to token usage, we offer multiple visualizations

### Improvements

* Improved the look of Step badges, specifically colors.
* Sharing threads requires additional privilege
* Improved UX on text, audio, image and video attachments in Step details
* Prompt versions show a visual "Open" button to jump to the Prompt Playground
* Revamped the UI look of the side navigation
* Stop sequences on Prompt Playground now show visual cues
* Removed UUID columns across tables to improve readability
* JSON & Text previews come with full screen & copy/paste options

### Fixes

* Newly created API keys do not contain special characters

# 0.0.606-beta (May 20, 2024)

### Breaking Changes

* Dataset: Renamed intermediary steps `expectedOutput` to `output`. In a Dataset, in the field `Indermediary Steps`, the field `expectedOutput` is renamed to just `output`, because this is the actual output of the LLM. This breaks backward compatibility for users relying on `DatasetItem.intermediarySteps.expectedOutput`, `DatasetItem.expectedOutput` remains unchanged.

### New Features

* Attachments now come with preview widgets (multi-modality)

### Improvements 

* A page change on tables now scrolls back to top of table
* We removed name fallback to ID for threads, now shown as N/A
* We reduced the indent of navigation sub-menus
* The prompt playground now persists the credentials for your session
* Improved user feedback options from the UI
* JSONs in tables now display on multiple lines with syntax highlighting
* Improved dashboard performance with data fetch in separate requests

### Fixes

* Fixed creation of attachments and scores when step doesn't exist
* Fixed thread duplication when filtering on errors
* Fixed the upserts of step input/output to prevent going past size limit


# 0.0.605-beta (May 13, 2024)

### New Features

* Support GPT-4o as LLM model provider
* We now display a diff of the prompt settings when saving a prompt version
* Steps are now supporting tags

### Improvements 

* We now populate the dataset item `intermediarySteps` when adding a step with children steps
* The API credentials in the prompt playground are moved
* Generation details view now has a link to prompt
* Support higher than 1 temperature setting for compatible LLMs

### Fixes

* Fix display bugs in prompt playground
* Fix a bug where we allow for very large json inputs
  * Now metadataare limited to 1mb
  * Step input and expectedOutput limited to 3mb
* Fix a bug where full-text searching threads would lead to a spike in cpu usage
* Fix a rare bug that could occur when ingesting multiple steps with a new tag

# 0.0.604-beta (May 6, 2024)

### New Features

* **UI/UX**: New button on the headers on the Literal AI platform of a page that links to the documentation. This improves the UX of the Literal AI platform.

* **Experiments/Score**: You are now able create Scores directly in Experiments.
* **Threads**: There is now a search bar in the Threads table.

### Improvements 

* Minor UI updates to:
  * Sidebar navigation

* Persist playground settings
* Warn when creating a prompt


### Fixes

    src="/images/changelog-evolution-04-29-2024.png"
    alt="Dashboard evolution badge"
  />
* **UI of Thread and Dataset**: On the top of a `Thread` or `Dataset` page there, the location is now shown as breadcrumb. This prevents getting lost in sheets and improves navigation. 
* **Settings UI**: Split `Settings` menu in the UI into sub-menus for `General`, `LLM` and `Team`. 
* **Prompts**: New `Created by` column on Prompt Version table, which improves the table display.


### Fixes

* **Prompt Playground**: Fix model select overflow (This is minimal change in the prompt playground. The long model name in the select is now ellipsed when size is reduced)
* **Experiments**: In `comparison` mode, parameters are made more explicit. In addition, the charts inversed, which is now fixed.
* **Filters**: `is null` and `not in` filters on tags edge cases are added. This fixes the tags filters in the table, as they were not working as intended before.
* **Tags**: Newly created `Tags` are now visible in the UI when a `Thread`, `Step` or `Generation` page is refreshed. Tags are now refetched on page refresh.
* **Tags**: `Tags` can now be added on generations being created.
