title: Roadmap
---

We are continuously developing to Literal AI. Our focus is on rolling out new features as well as improving the Developer Experience. 

We release a new [guide, tutorial or cookbook](/guides/overview) for every new feature in Literal AI.

Upcoming new features: 

### Roles and Orgs

Currently in Literal AI, you can define [`Roles` and `Projects`](/concepts/settings) for collaboration. The project management will be improved with more ganular control over permission:
* Customization: You will be able to define custom roles with specific permissions. Diverse users and organizational structures will be able to manage their projects in Literal AI. 
* Security: More granular permission settings reduces the rist ok unauthorized access or actions. 

### Dashboard

The User Experience of the Dashboard in Literal AI will be improved. You will be able to visualize and analyze your data more efficiently, using new chart features. Main focus points in this improvement are: 
* Enhance Data Interaction: visually interact with your data to intuitively extract insights. 
* Scalability: manage different scales of data and user count without performance degradation. 
* Smooth transition: as little change in code base and database as possible.

### Online Experiments on Literal AI

Right now, you can run experiments from your code, and view and compare the results in Literal AI. With this new feature you will be able to do online experiments on the Literal AI platform (server-side evaluation instead of client-side). Server-side online evaluation is: score Generation objects as Literal AI ingests them. As a new Generation in a Thread comes in, an automatic evaluation of the content of this LLM Generation is triggered. You can view the performance of your LLM Generations directly in the platform. You enable this by setting an evaluation rule by some metric that you define. 

### Streams 

This feature is about supporting continuous data streams in your LLM applications. For example, live voice conversation and video streams.
