title: Tags, Scores and Metadata
---

In Literal AI, you can add Tags, Scores and Metadata to units like Threads, Steps, Runs and Generations. What do they mean and when do you use which type? 

## Tags

[Tags](/concepts/observability/tags) can be assigned to Threads, Steps and Generations. You can label these units to filter data. Tags are shared across units, application-wide. For example, Rags could be related to data management such as "to review" or "reviewed". Tags could also be related to the nature of the question. For a customer support bot, you could have "billing", "return policy", etc.


## Scores 

[Scores](/concepts/observability/scores) allow you to evaluate the LLM system performance at three levels: LLM generations, Agent Runs and Conversation Threads. This can be used to track the performance and accuracy of your system. Scores can be human generated (human feedback, like a thump up or down), or AI generated (hallucination evaluation for instance). A score or feedback can be assigned to a Generation, Step or Thread. Scores can be visualized on the dashboard in charts, and data can be filtered by scores.


## Metadata

[Metadata](/concepts/observability/step#metadata) enriches objects with additional context, details, or configuration that can be instrumental in customizing and enhancing the functionality of each object. Metadata can be added to Thread, Step, User, and Generation. Metadata adds parameters that are unique to that Thread, Step, User or Generation. 


## Example

Let's review this in an example. 

#### 1. Create a Thread, with Metadata to a Step

<CodeGroup>
```python Python

import os
import time
from literalai import LiteralClient

literal_client = LiteralClient(api_key=os.getenv("LITERAL_API_KEY"))

def main():
    # You can also continue a thread by passing the thread id
    with literal_client.thread(name="Thread Example") as thread:

      # add user query step to the thread, with metadata
      user_query = "Hello, can I ask you a question?"
      literal_client.message(content=user_query, type="user_message", name="User", metadata={"location":"France"})

      # send assistant message to the thread, without metadata
      response = "Yes, how can I help you?"
      literal_client.message(content=response, type="assistant_message", name="Assistant")

main()
# Network requests by the SDK are performed asynchronously.
# Invoke flush_and_stop() to guarantee the completion of all requests prior to the process termination.
# WARNING: If you run a continuous server, you should not use this method.
client.flush_and_stop()
```

```typescript TypeScript
import { LiteralClient, Thread } from "@literalai/client";

const literalClient = new LiteralClient(process.env["LITERAL_API_KEY"]);

async function main() {
  await literalClient.thread({ name: 'Thread Example' }).wrap(async () => {
    const userQuery = 'Hello, can I ask you a question?';
    await literalClient
      .step({
        type: 'user_message',
        name: 'User',
        output: { content: userQuery },
        metadata: { location: 'France' }
      })
      .send();
  });
}
```

</CodeGroup>


#### 2. View Step Metadata in UI

If you run the code above, you've created a thread with two steps. One step, the user query, has metadata attached. Let's view this in the Literal AI UI.

<Frame caption="Metadata view in Literal AI">
  <img src="/images/metadata-ui.png" alt="Metadata view in Literal AI" />
</Frame>


#### 3. Add Tags to Thread

In the UI and in code, we can add Tags to the Thread and individual Steps. 

<Frame caption="Add a Tag to a Thread">
  <img src="/images/add-tag-thread.png" alt="Add a Tag to a Thread" />
</Frame>

<CodeGroup>
```python Python

import os
import asyncio
from literalai import LiteralClient

literal_client = LiteralClient(api_key=os.getenv("LITERAL_API_KEY"))

def add_tags():
    updated_thread = literal_client.api.update_thread(
        id="e39b9a4c-ec8f-4ddb-8c0d-acbd2274d476", # thread uuid
        tags=["example"], # add tags here
    )

add_tags()

# Network requests by the SDK are performed asynchronously.
# Invoke flush_and_stop() to guarantee the completion of all requests prior to the process termination.
# WARNING: If you run a continuous server, you should not use this method.
client.flush_and_stop()
```

```typescript TypeScript
import { LiteralClient, Thread } from "@literalai/client";

const literalClient = new LiteralClient(process.env["LITERAL_API_KEY"]);

const thread = await literalClient.api.upsertThread({ 
  threadId: "e39b9a4c-ec8f-4ddb-8c0d-acbd2274d476", // thread uuid
  tags: ["example"]}
); // add tags here
```

</CodeGroup>

#### 4. Add Score

Finally, we can add a Score to a Step. Let's evaluate how good the response of the assistant was. We can do this in the UI or by code.

<Frame caption="Add Score to Step">
  <img src="/images/add-score-ui.png" alt="Add Score to Step" />
</Frame>

<CodeGroup>
```python Python

import os
import asyncio
from literalai import LiteralClient

literal_client = LiteralClient(api_key=os.getenv("LITERAL_API_KEY"))

def add_score():
    score = literal_client.api.create_score(
        step_id="4271d21b-efb3-41bd-b8fc-7e060a6461de", # step uuid
        name="accurate", # name of the score
        type="HUMAN", # Human or AI generated
        comment="This is a good answer", # additional comment to the score
        value=1, # the numerical score
    )

add_score()

# Network requests by the SDK are performed asynchronously.
# Invoke flush_and_stop() to guarantee the completion of all requests prior to the process termination.
# WARNING: If you run a continuous server, you should not use this method.
client.flush_and_stop()
```

```typescript TypeScript
import { LiteralClient, Thread } from "@literalai/client";

const literalClient = new LiteralClient(process.env["LITERAL_API_KEY"]);

const score = await literalClient.api.createScore({ 
  stepId: "4271d21b-efb3-41bd-b8fc-7e060a6461de", // step uuid
  name: 'accurate', // name of the score
  type: 'HUMAN', // Human or AI generated
  comment: 'This is a good answer', // additional comment to the score
  value: 1, // the numerical score
});
```

</CodeGroup>

#### 5. View Scores and Filter by Tags

You can review Human or AI evaluations in the `Scores` tab in the UI. You can filter scores by Step Tags.

<Frame caption="View Scores">
  <img src="/images/view-scores-ui.png" alt="View Scores" />
</Frame>

You can Filter Threads by Tags assigned to Threads, like we did in this example.
