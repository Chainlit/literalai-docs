It covers a wide range of use cases such as agentic applications, RAG, chat bots and task automation. Literal AI integrates seemlessly with third parties such as [OpenAI](/integrations/openai),  [LangChain](/integrations/langchain) or [Llama Index](/integrations/llama-index).

<Note>
Literal AI is developed by the builders of [Chainlit](https://github.com/Chainlit/chainlit), the open-source Conversational AI Python framework.
