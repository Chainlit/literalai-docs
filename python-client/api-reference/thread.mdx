## Thread

```python
class Thread(Utils)
```

## Using the `with` statement

If you prefer to have more flexibility in logging Threads, you can use the `with` statement. You can create a thread and execute code within it using the `with` statement:

<CodeGroup>
```python
with literalai_client.thread() as thread:
    # do something
```
</CodeGroup>

You can also continue a thread by passing the thread id to the `thread` method:

<CodeGroup>
```python

previous_thread_id = "UUID"

with literalai_client.thread(thread_id=previous_thread_id) as thread:
    # do something
```
</CodeGroup>

## Using the Literal AI API client

You can also create Threads using the `literalai_client.api.create_thread()` method.

<CodeGroup>
```python
thread = literalai_client.api.create_thread(
    participant_id="<PARTICIPANT_UUID>",
    environment="production",
    tags=["tag1", "tag2"],
    metadata={"key": "value"},
)
```
</CodeGroup>

## Using Chainlit

If you built your LLM application with Chainlit, you don't need to specify Threads in your code. Chainlit logs Threads for you by default.
