Scorers are the basic building blocks of evaluation. 
They are used to score `Steps` or `Generations` based on a `Score Schema`.

To create a scorer, go to the `Scorers` page and click on the `+` button in the upper right corner of the table.
Here's an example of the flow:

<Frame caption="Create Scorer">
  <img
    src="/images/create-scorer.gif"
    alt="Create Scorer"
  />
</Frame>

Once you have created a scorer, your next step is to use it.
