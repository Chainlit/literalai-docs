title: Evaluating User Satisfaction & Customer Support Conversations
---

The source code of this notebook can be found in the Literal AI [Github Cookbooks](https://github.com/Chainlit/literal-cookbook/blob/main/python/evaluate-user-satisfaction/Evaluate%20user%20satisfaction.ipynb).

This notebook shows you how to retrieve your Customer Support Conversations from Literal and evaluate user satisfaction on this conversational data.  

We leverage OpenAI's API to score the threads with a custom prompt template, and finally plot user satisfaction.

## Import the Literal AI SDK

<CodeGroup>
```python Import Literal AI SDK
import os

from openai import AsyncOpenAI
from dotenv import load_dotenv
from literalai import LiteralClient

load_dotenv()

openai_client = AsyncOpenAI()

literal_client = LiteralClient(batch_size=10)
literal_client.instrument_openai()
```
</CodeGroup>

## Create Threads (Optional)

If you have conversational data &ndash; `Thread` objects in Literal AI, skip to [View Thread details](#view-thread-details).  

Otherwise, run the next cell to populate a few fictional conversations.

<CodeGroup>
```python Create Threads
"""
This array contains 8 (fictional) conversational threads which took place between a user
and an assistant. We create those threads directly in Literal AI via a mimicking application.

# Agent logic to implement below.
@literal_client.step(type="run", name="Agent logic - Scheduling & calls to tools")
def agent_logic():
    with literal_client.step(type="tool", name="Query ERM database"):
        pass
    with literal_client.step(type="llm", name="Call LLM"):
        pass

@literal_client.thread(tags=["to_score"])
def run_conversation(thread_messages):

    for message in thread_messages:

</CodeGroup>

## View Thread details

The below screen capture shows how the first thread appears in Literal AI, with the user and the assistant going back and forth on the issue at hand.  

You should see an equivalent flow if you have actual conversational data in your project. 

<Frame caption="Thread Details">

    alt="Thread Details"
  />
</Frame>

## Get Threads

We are now set to get the threads to score.  

From the **Threads** table, you can filter on the threads with the `to_score` tag, and then click "Export":  

<Frame caption="Threads Table">
  <img
    src="/images/guides/evaluating-user-satisfaction/threads-table.png"
    alt="Threads Table"
  />
</Frame>

The **Export Threads** window pops up and provides the exact filters to pass to the `get_threads` API.  
Copy and paste below to fetch your selected threads via the SDK.  

<Frame caption="Export Threads">
  <img
    src="/images/guides/evaluating-user-satisfaction/export-threads.png"
    alt="Export Threads"
  />
</Frame>

With our fictional threads, we will simply filter down on the `to_score` tag:

<CodeGroup>
```python Add Score Tag
threads = literal_client.api.get_threads(filters=[{
    "field": "tags",
    "operator": "in",
    "value": ["to_score"]
}], step_types_to_keep=["user_message", "assistant_message"]).data

print(f"Number of fetched threads: {len(threads)}")
```
</CodeGroup>


## Create evaluation prompt template

<CodeGroup>
```python Create Evaluation Prompt Template
template_messages = [
    {
        "role": "system",
        "content": "You are a helpful assistant."
    },
    {
        "role": "user",
        "content": """
Context:

You are an advanced language model tasked with evaluating a conversation between a customer support agent and a user. Your goal is to assess the agent's effectiveness in addressing and solving the user's request or problem. The conversation will be provided to you, and based on your analysis, you will assign a score that reflects the agent's performance.

Instructions:

1. Read the Conversation: Carefully read the provided dialogue between the customer support agent and the user. Pay attention to the details of the user's request or problem, the responses from the agent, and the overall flow of the conversation.

2. Evaluate Based on Key Criteria:
   - Effectiveness of Response: Evaluate the relevance and accuracy of the information provided by the agent. Consider if the responses were clear and helpful towards solving the user's problem.
   - Efficiency: Consider how efficiently the agent worked towards a resolution. This includes the timeliness of responses and whether the conversation progressed towards a solution without unnecessary detours.
   - Resolution: Determine if the conversation ended with the user's issue being resolved or with a clear path towards resolution.

3. Assign a Score: Based on your evaluation, assign a score to the agent's performance using the following scale:
   - 1 (Poor): The agent was not able to provide a solution to the user.
   - 2 (Fair): The agent showed some understanding of the issue and gave a workaround to the user, but nothing more; The issue remained.
   - 3 (Good): The agent understood the user's issue and provided helpful information.
   - 4 (Very Good): The agent demonstrated a strong understanding of the problem, responded with relevant and effective solutions. The user's issue was nearly or fully resolved.
   - 5 (Excellent): The agent provided highly effective and efficient responses, and resolved the user's problem completely.

After evaluating the conversation based on the criteria above, provide your score as an integer between 1 and 5. Only answer with a single character in the following value {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}.
Don't provide explanations, only the single integer value.

Conversation:

{{#thread_messages}}
{{role}}: {{content}}
{{/thread_messages}}

Scoring Output:

"""
    }
]

prompt = literal_client.api.get_or_create_prompt(name="Satisfaction Evaluation prompt", template_messages=template_messages)
```
</CodeGroup>

## Score threads

### Define helper to build thread messages

<CodeGroup>
```python Build thread messages helper
def build_messages(thread):
    """
        Format the steps' messages to OpenAI's format, as 
        [{ "role": , "content": }]
    """
    messages = []
    for step in thread.steps:
        messages.append({
            "role": step.type.split('_')[0],
            "content": step.output["content"]
        })

    return messages
```
</CodeGroup>

### Score using OpenAI

To ensure we get an integer user satisfaction score, we rely on [Outlines](https://outlines-dev.github.io/outlines/) to guarantee the generated output is in the 1 to 5 range.

<CodeGroup>
```python Output range
import tiktoken

from outlines.models.openai import OpenAI as OutlinesOpenAI
from outlines.models.openai import OpenAIConfig as OutlinesOpenAIConfig
from outlines import generate

config = OutlinesOpenAIConfig(model="gpt-3.5-turbo", temperature=0)
tokenizer = tiktoken.encoding_for_model("gpt-3.5-turbo")

model = OutlinesOpenAI(openai_client, config, tokenizer)

categories = ["1", "2", "3", "4", "5"]
generator = generate.choice(model, categories)

thread_scores = []
for thread in threads:
    messages = prompt.format_messages(thread_messages=build_messages(thread))
    completion = generator(prompt=messages[1]["content"], max_tokens=1)
    thread_scores.append(completion)
```
</CodeGroup>

## Visualize User Satisfaction

<CodeGroup>
```python Visualize
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

color = ['#f24610', '#f88f00', '#ffcd00', '#7cbd38', '#009342']
values = [thread_scores.count(c) for c in categories]

fig, ax = plt.subplots()

ax.bar(categories, values, color=color)
ax.set_xlabel("Score")
ax.set_ylabel("# Conversations")

plt.title("User Satisfaction")
plt.show()
```
</CodeGroup>


<Frame caption="Output visualization">
  <img
    src="/images/guides/evaluating-user-satisfaction/output_18_0.png"
    alt="Output visualization"
  />
</Frame>


## Change Threads tags 
Change the tags from `to_score` to `scored`.

<CodeGroup>
```python Update Thread tag
for thread in threads:
    literal_client.api.update_thread(id=thread.id, tags=["scored"])
```
</CodeGroup>

And the threads we had to score show up as `scored` !

<Frame caption="Scored Threads">
  <img
    src="/images/guides/evaluating-user-satisfaction/threads-scored.png"
    alt="Scored Threads"
  />
</Frame>
