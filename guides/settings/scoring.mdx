## Score Schemas

Literal AI offers an easy way to manage scores: **Score Schemas**.

With **Score Schemas**, admin users can control and expose to all users the various types of evaluations
allowed in their application. **Score Schemas** come in two flavors: 
- **Categorical** -- Schemas let you create a set of categories, each tied to a numeric value.
- **Continuous** -- Schemas with a **[min; max]** range which users score in.

For **Categorical** Schemas, each category has a description which is used to guide the scorer (be it **Human** or **AI**) in selecting the most 
relevant category.

Here's how to create a Score Schema:

<Frame caption="Create Score Schema">
  <img
    src="/images/create-score-schema.gif"
    alt="Create a Score Schema"
  />
</Frame>

Feel free to browse your steps from the Logs tab and simply add a "Human Review" directly on your `Step` and `Generation` entities:

<Frame caption="Score a Generation">
  <img
    src="/images/score-generation.gif"
    alt="Score a Generation"
  />
</Frame>

To go through a wide range of logs, leverage [annotation queues](/guides/annotation-queue) 
which make it easier to streamline the review process.
