## Literal AI Projects

You can have multiple projects in Literal AI, each with its own set of members, roles, and settings.  
Projects are the primary way to organize your work and collaborate with your team.

### Project settings

Project-level settings in Literal AI contain:
- **General** information: 
    - Manage Literal AI API keys to log your application runs.
    - Tags: Customize and manage tags to categorize and label your data
    - Project lifecycle: Manage your project's lifecycle, including deletion.
- **LLM**: Manage provider credentials for the LLMs used in your project and define costs per model.
- **Scoring**: Define and manage Score Schemas to consistently evaluate and measure your AI models' performance.
- **Team**: Manage your project's members, roles and permissions.


### Manage Literal AI API Keys

To copy or create a new API key, go to the `Settings` page and look for the **Literal AI API Keys** section.

Each API key is associated with a specific project, user and role.
