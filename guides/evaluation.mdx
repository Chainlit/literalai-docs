## Why evaluate?

Evaluation is key to enable continuous deployment of LLM-based applications and guarantee that newer
versions perform better than previous ones. To best capture the **user experience** one must understand the
multiple steps which make up the application. As AI applications grow in complexity, they tend to chain 
multiple steps.

Literal AI lets you log & monitor the various steps of your LLM application. By doing so, you can continuously improve the performance of your LLM system, building the most relevant metrics:

| Level          | Metrics                                       |
|----------------|--------------------------------------------|
| LLM Generation | Hallucination, Toxicity, etc.                 |
| Agent Run      | Task completion, Number of intermediate steps |
| Conversation Thread         | User satisfaction                             |


An example is the vanilla **Retrieval Augmented Generation** (RAG), which augments Large Language Models
(LLMs) with domain-specific data. Examples of metrics you can score against are: context relevancy, faithfulness, answer relevancy, etc.


## How to think about evaluation?

Scores are a crucial part of developing and improving your LLM application or agent.

| Who?  | When?           | Type of eval metrics | Example                                             |
|---------------|------------------|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| End-User      | In Production     | Explicit Feedback (üëçüëé)        | Thumbs-up or down on a chatbot's answer             |
| End-User      | In Production     | Implicit Feedback based on product metric        | User conversion to paid offering increases by 15%   |
| LLM-as-a-Judge | In Production  | AI evaluation (without ground truth) | Hallucination, context relevancy, etc. |
| LLM-as-a-Judge | During Iteration  | AI evaluation against a Dataset (with ground truth or not) | Hallucination, conciseness, helpfulness, context relevancy, answer similarity, etc. |
| Domain Expert | During Iteration  | Human evaluation against a Dataset (with ground truth or not)  | Hallucination, conciseness, helpfulness, context relevancy, answer similarity, etc. |


## Evaluate LLM logs in production automatically
Automating the evaluation of your [Run outputs or LLM generations](/guides/logs#semantics) can really help to monitor and improve your LLM app in production, especially with large volumes of data.

### Configure an evaluation rule 

Go to the dashboard and click on `Configure Rules` to create/manage rules.

<Frame caption="Pick a Rule Type">
  <img src="/images/rule-type.png" alt="Pick a rule type" />
</Frame>

Once you picked a Rule Type, you will be able to update existing rules or create new ones.

<Frame caption="Manage your Rules">
  <img src="/images/rules.png" alt="Rules" />
</Frame>

A rule is composed of:

- **Name**: A name to identify the rule.
- **Sample Rate**: The percentage of outputs that will be evaluated by the rule.
- **Filters**: Additional conditions to decide if the rule should be triggered.
- **LLM**: The model to use for the evaluation.

#### Configure a score schema

A rule outputing a score will be based on a **Score Schema** which is a definition of the possible categories to evaluate the output.

A rule outputing a tag will be require a list of possible tags.

<Note>As of now, the prompt used for the evaluation is handled by Literal AI. We are working to allow you to specify your own eval prompt.</Note>

### Evaluate with a custom eval metrics (sdk)

The SDKs provide score creation APIs with all fields exposed. Scores must be tied either
to a Step or a Generation object.

<CodeGroup>
```python Python
import os
from literalai import LiteralClient

literal_client = LiteralClient(api_key=os.getenv("LITERAL_API_KEY"))

score = literal_client.api.create_score(
            step_id="<STEP_UUID>",
            name="context-relevancy",
            type="AI",
            comment="context is relevant to the question",
            value=0.9,
        )
```

```typescript TypeScript
import { LiteralClient, ChatGeneration} from "@literalai/client";

const literalClient = new LiteralClient(process.env["LITERAL_API_KEY"]);

async function main() {
    const score = await literalClient.api.createScore({
        stepId: '<STEP_UUID>',
        name: 'context-relevancy',
        type: 'AI',
        comment: 'context is relevant to the question',
        value: 0.9,
      });
      
};
main();
```
</CodeGroup>


## Label LLM logs on Literal AI

The Literal AI application offers an easy way to manage scores: Score Schema. 

Via Score Schemas, admin users can control and expose to users the various types of evaluations
allowed from the application. Score Templates come in two flavors: *Categorical* and *Continuous*. 

*Categorical* templates let you create a set of categories, each tied to a numeric value.
*Continuous* templates offer a minimum and a maximum value which users can then select from to score.


From a Step or a Generation, admins can then score by selecting a template and filling
in the required form fields.
<Frame caption="Label an LLM Generation">
  <img
    src="/images/create-score-template.png"
    alt="Label an LLM Generation"
  />
</Frame>
For simple adding of Scores, you can do it from the Logs tab. 
If you plan to annotate a batch of logs, leverage the [annotation queue](/guides/annotation-queue.mdx)


## Automate actions based on evaluation results

### Add to Datasets/Annotation Queues

üöß Work in progress, coming soon üöß

### Add labels

## Monitor evaluation results

Once your rules are set up, you can monitor their activity in the dashboard.

<Frame caption="Monitor your Rules">
  <img src="/images/monitor-rule.png" alt="Monitor Rules" />
</Frame>

You can see the number of invocation per rule as well as the average score of the evaluations.

You can also access the logs of the evaluations to look for potential errors.
