The Literal AI platform helps you organise and streamline the human evaluation process by easily setting-up annotation queues.
Each queue let you add data for review and provides an accessible and efficient ui for domain experts to score, tag and add to datasets crucial insights.

## Creating an annotation queue

You can access your queues on the "Annotation Queues" page, and create them by pressing the "+" button in the top right corner of the table.

</Frame>

This will open a modal form, that you can fill with a **name** to identify the annotation queue and a **description** to convey the queue meaning.

<Note>Each new project comes with a "Default" annotation queue.</Note>

## Populating a queue with data

With your queues created you can manually add items to review by accessing your run/generation logs, selecting them and clicking "Add to Annotation Queue".

## Review queues

On the "Annotation Queues" page, a reviewer can open a specific queue and start reviewing added items. They can provide you with human feedback by scoring and tagging each item.

A reviewer can also add a specific step to an existing dataset for further processing.

Finally, once the work is done, they can mark the item as Reviewed.

## More granular control

To keep track of what is happening in the queues, we also provide a list of Annotation Queue items for super users.
