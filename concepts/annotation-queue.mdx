## Create an annotation queue

You can access your queues on the `Annotation Queues` page, and create one by clicking the `+` button in the top right corner of the table.

<Frame caption="Annotation Queues Page">
  <img src="/images/create-queue.gif" alt="Create annotation queue" />
</Frame>

This will open a modal form, that you can fill with a **name** to identify the annotation queue and a **description** to convey the queue meaning.

<Note>Each new project comes with a "Default" annotation queue.</Note>

## Populate a queue with data

Once you have created a queue, you can start adding data to it. You can add runs/generations at once from the logs page. 

<Frame caption="Add Multiple Items to the Annotation Queue">
  <video
    autoPlay
    muted
    loop
    playsInline
    src="/images/add-multiple-to-queue.mp4"
  />
</Frame>

You can also add a single item to the queue from a thread/run/generation detail page.

<Frame caption="Add a Single Item to the Annotation Queue">
  <video
    autoPlay
    muted
    loop
    playsInline
    src="/images/add-one-to-queue.mp4"
  />
</Frame>

## Efficiently review queue items

On the `Annotation Queues` page, a reviewer can open a specific queue and start reviewing added items.

<Frame caption="Annotation Queue Item Page">
  <img src="/images/annotation-queue.png" alt="The annotation item page" />
</Frame>

A reviewer can:

- **Score** the item
- **Tag** the item
- **Add to Dataset** the item

Finally, once the review is done, they can mark the item as Reviewed.

## Check progress

Admins can monitor the progress of the queues on the `Annotation Queues` page by clicking on the `Admin View` button.


<Frame caption="Annotation Queue Items List Page">
  <video
    autoPlay
    muted
    loop
    playsInline
    src="/images/annotation-queue-admin-view.mp4"
  />
</Frame>

In this view, the Admin can switch between the `Pending` and `Reviewed` tabs to see how many items are left to review and how many have been reviewed.
